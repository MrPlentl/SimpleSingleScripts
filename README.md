# Simple Single Script
### Cause sometimes I just need a Simple Solution

### Always Under Development
I'm always adding new stuff. Though everything checkedoin should word... theoretically.

## The Goal
Everything in here is is not just simple and easy to use, but it's small. Only one file to be exact. 
The point of these scripts is to execute their purpose while making the smallest footprint.


## Reporting a bug

To report a bug simply create a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/MrPlentl/SimpleSingleScripts/issues/new) and describe
your problem or suggestion. I welcome all kinds of feedback (especially efficiency techniques) regarding the
any of my SimpleSingleScripts but not limited to:

 * When my SSS don't work as expected
 * When my SSS blows up and flatout doesn't work

Before reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets
that cover your issue. Feel free to shoot me a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/thabamboozlr/) if you just have a question.
